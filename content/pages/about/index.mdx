Hey! I'm Megha Pathak. This blog is my digital sky, I breathe ideas, my learnings and experiences here.

Glad to see you here! I am a Product-minded, curiosity-driven [Developer](https://meghapathak.netlify.com/) passionate about envisioning and developing great products.
I often write about Product Management, Community building and Web Developemt.

I've been hanging around on the internet from long while self-learning experimenting with everything and anything that piques my interest, so I remember a time when websites were fun, decentralized, personal havens of creativity. Through all these years there are so many things that I explored about myself and the world around me, I want this blog to be a beautiful corner of the web, where I document my exploration while encouraging others to make their own as well.

Tighten your belt and let me fly you through this blog. ‚úàÔ∏è

### üåé First destination - Open Source
I also like to make open source projects, all of which can be found on GitHub. 
When I started my journey with Open Source development, it instantly made me fall in love with it. I am a precher of the notion of learning by doing and Open Source definitely amplified it for me. 
üî≠ Building [Season of Design](https://github.com/codeuino/Design-Initiative-Dashboard-frontend) at [CodeUino](https://github.com/codeuino) these days. 
If you love any Open Source Project or Community. Do let me know, I would love to know about and Contribute to it.
